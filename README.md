# Simple Linear Regression

## Overview
This project is part of an internship assignment aimed at understanding the basics of regression analysis. The goal is to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable using simple linear regression. This foundational project will pave the way for more complex regression techniques and their applications in various domains.

## Project Description
Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:
- **Dependent Variable (Y)**: The variable we are trying to predict or explain.
- **Independent Variable (X)**: The variable we are using to make predictions about the dependent variable.

In this project, we will:
- Understand the concept of linear regression.
- Implement simple linear regression using Python.
- Visualize the relationship between the variables.
- Evaluate the performance of the regression model.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
